      <p>«He does not confine himself inside contradictions; on the contrary, he opens out and, like a spore case inflated with spores, releases them as so many singularities that he had improperly shut off, some of which he intended to exclude, while retaining others, but which now become points-signs, all affirmed by their new distance. The disjunction, being now inclusive, does not closet itself inside its own terms. On the contrary it is nonrestrictive. "I was then no longer this closed box to which I owed being so well preserved, but a partition came crashing down" [...]»<br><br>Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari. Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia
